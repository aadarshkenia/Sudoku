PUZZLE GENERATION:

1. First generate a valid Sudoku board using a backtracking approach. Then select random Positions and remove the value from the chosen random position. Now evaluate if the solution to the puzzle after removing this value is unique or not. If unique, then the value in this position can be removed. 

2. To generate Puzzles of varying difficulty, create a list of all 91 position objects after generating the valid Sudoku board. Now, an easy puzzle can be generated by breaking the while loop in generate() when the puzzle has more than one solution. Note that this implies that the value at the selected position cannot be removed without destroying the uniqueness of solution. However, this does not imply that other positions from the list cannot be emptied (set to -1). Therefore, harder puzzles can be generated by trying to nullify all possible Positions that can be emptied and at the same time keeping the uniqueness of the solution valid. This would be the hardest puzzle to solve.
