Optimization strategies:

1. For generating puzzle, fill up random positions. While selecting a random position, first create a list of UNFILLED positions and then randomly select one from it. If we first choose a random position and then check if its filled, that would be slower. Also, once a list of unfilled positions is obtained, its easy to remove a position generated by randomizer from this list and update the list for next iteration.
